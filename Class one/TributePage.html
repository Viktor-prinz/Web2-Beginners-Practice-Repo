            <!-- Story about his early life -->
            <h3>Childhood & Early Life</h3>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali.<br> He was adopted by Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs.<br> Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs</p>
            <p>Schieble gave birth to Jobs in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",<br> but the couple later changed their minds. He was then placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, who lacked wealth and college education, and Schieble refused<br> to sign the adoption papers. She asked the court to find a different family, but consented when Paul and Clara pledged to fund his college education.</p>
            <p>Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist, several other jobs, and then "back to work as a machinist". Paul and Clara adopted<br> Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. Paul built a workbench<br> in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics”. Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything.</p>
            <p>By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.<br> He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner". Home of Paul and Clara Jobs,<br> on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California Childhood family home of Steve Jobs on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, and the original site of Apple Computer.</P>
            <P>The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 2013. Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom,<br> tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and was suspended a few times. Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that<br> he was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher."</P> 
            <p>He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child)<br> never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son. The location of the Los Altos home meant that<br> Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley. He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Bill Fernandez,<br> who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would become Apple's first employee.</p>
            <p>Jobs developed two different interests: electronics and literature. These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year<br> as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan. In 1971, after Wozniak began attending University of California, Berkeley,<br> Jobs would visit him there a few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's student union.</p>
            <p>In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford.<br> After just one semester, Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents. Jobs later explained this was because he did not want to spend his parents'<br> money on an education that seemed meaningless to him. He continued to attend by auditing his classes, including a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino.</p>

            <h3>Steve Job's Life & Innovations</h3>
            <ul>
                <p><li>1972 - After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, for two years.<br> He dropped out after one semester to visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of 1974.</li></p>
                <p><li>1975 - In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical whiz named Steve Wozniak, was trying to build a computer.<br> Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.</li></p>
                <p><li>1976 - In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own company. They called it Apple Computer Company, in memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent picking apples.<br> They raised $1,300 in startup money by selling Jobs's microbus and Wozniak's calculator. At first they sold circuit boards (the boards that hold the internal components of a computer)<br> while they worked on the computer prototype (sample).</li></p>
                <p><li>1984 - In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh. The on-screen display had small pictures called icons.<br> To use the computer, the user pointed at an icon and clicked a button using a new device called a mouse. This process made the Macintosh very easy to use.<br> The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses, however. It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer.</li></p>
                <p><li>1985 - The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Jobs resigned in 1985 from the company he had helped found,<br> though he retained his title as chairman of its board of directors. Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer company called NeXT.</li></p>
                <p><li>1988 - Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced at a large gala event in San Francisco, aimed at the educational market. Initial reactions were generally good.<br> The product was very user-friendly, and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays, and an outstanding sound system. Despite the warm reception, however,<br> the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.</li></p>
                <p><li>1986 - NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. In 1986 Jobs purchased a small company called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas (1944).<br> Pixar specialized in computer animation. Nine years later Pixar released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to make Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life,<br> which Disney distributed, and Monsters, Inc. All these films have been extremely successful. Monsters, Inc. had the largest opening weekend ticket sales of any animated film in history.</li></p>
                <p><li>1996 - In December of 1996 Apple purchased NeXT Software for over $400 million. Jobs returned to Apple as a part-time consultant to the chief executive officer (CEO).<br> The following year, in a surprising event, Apple entered into a partnership with its competitor Microsoft. The two companies, according to the New York Times,<br> "agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts." Over the next six years Apple introduced several new products and marketing strategies.</li></p>
                <p><li>1997 - In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly to users over the Internet and by telephone. The Apple Store became a runaway success.<br> Within a week it was the third-largest e-commerce site on the Internet. In September of 1997 Jobs was named interim CEO of Apple.</li></p>
                <p><li>1998 - Jobs announced the release of the iMac, which featured powerful computing at an affordable price. The iBook was unveiled in July 1999.<br> This is a clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright colors. It includes Apple's AirPort, a computer version of the cordless phone that would allow<br> the user to surf the Internet wirelessly. In January 2000 Jobs unveiled Apple's new Internet strategy. It included a group of Macintosh-only Internet-based applications.<br> Jobs also announced that he was becoming the permanent CEO of Apple.</li></p>
                <p><li>2005 - Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.<br> The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007.</li></p>

            <!-- Steve Job's death -->
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic<br> neuroendocrine tumor,which resulted in respiratory arrest. He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.<br> His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.</p>
            <p>Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them.<br> Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011,<br> the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public.</p>
